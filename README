litl Game of Life channel

initially written by David Ignacio <dignacio@litl.com>

the inspiration for this channel was taken from Conway's game of life [0]

features:
* the "world" is currently displayed as 45x80, the sides wrap left<->right and top<->bottom to form a pseudo toroidal type of world.
* the size of the world is configurable from the options available in focus view
* the world is initially populated randomly with >33% coverage
* runs at one generation every 100ms
* color of the cell is determined by life, and how many neighbors are alive.  the colors are different saturations of litl blue
* go button restarts the game
* game automatically restarts after 600 generations
* game pauses when off screen

things to do:
* make speed of generation an option
* make initial population coverage an option
* make max generation an option
* improve cycle/dead state detection
* click to "inject" alive cells?
* add a favicon

this was developed using the following:
* adobe flex sdk 4.0.0 (not the open source one) [1]
* litl flash channel sdk [2]
* sun java 1.6 [3]
* ant [4]
* adobe air 2 rc1 (for the simulator) [5]

setting up
* checkout this source (i use ~/checkout/gameoflife-channel)
* copy build.properties.template to build.properties
* modify build.properties to point to sdk paths
    i copied the adobe flex sdk to /opt/flex-sdk_4.0.0
    and the litl flash channel sdk to /opt/litl-sdk

building
* cd to the source (cd ~/checkout/gameoflife-channel)
* run ant (ant)

testing/running swf
* install flash debug plugin (/opt/flex-sdk_4.0.0/runtimes/player)
* install adobe air 2 rc1 [5]
* install the litl simulator (/opt/litl-sdk/simulator)

* run the simulator
* open the built swf in a browser (i'm using firefox and chromium)
    usually it's in ~/checkout/gameoflife-channel/build/deploy/main.swf

packaging for submission
* cd to the source (cd ~/checkout/gameoflife-channel)
* run ant target (ant build-release-zip)
   creates ~/checkout/build/deploy.zip for use in the developer site to
   upload the new version of your channel
